| Disease Category | Total Trials | Female Representation (%) | Expected Female (%) | Chi-square | P-value | Significant Deviation |
|-----------------|--------------|-------------------------|-------------------|------------|---------|---------------------|
| COVID-19 | 310 | 50.1 | 50.8 | 0.04 | 0.844 | No |
| HIV/AIDS | 653 | 48.8 | 50.8 | 0.85 | 0.357 | No |
| Cancer | 59 | 50.0 | 50.8 | 0.00 | 1.000 | No |
| Cardiovascular | 13 | 50.0 | 50.8 | 0.00 | 1.000 | No |
| Infectious Disease | 102 | 50.7 | 50.8 | 0.00 | 1.000 | No |
| Respiratory | 29 | 50.0 | 50.8 | 0.00 | 1.000 | No |
| Mental Health | 3 | 50.0 | 50.8 | 0.00 | 1.000 | No |

| Other | 655 | 50.5 | 50.8 | 0.01 | 0.914 | No |
| **Overall** | **1,825** | **50.1** | **50.8** | **0.04** | **0.844** | **No** |

Note: Expected female representation (50.8%) based on 2025 US population estimates. Chi-square tests compare observed versus expected sex distributions. P-values > 0.05 indicate no significant deviation from expected representation.
